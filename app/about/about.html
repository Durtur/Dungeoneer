                <h1>About</h1>

                <p>This app has been in development since early 2017, when I started upgrading from my old DMing Excel
                    sheet. I created a basic app to make my DMing life a little bit
                    easier and more efficient. It's main function is to be a convenient place to look up rules and
                    monsters (SRD and homebrewed), and to keep track of initiative and HP in combat.</p>

                <p>
                    Since then I've added a few things, mainly tools to generate things such as treasure, NPC's and
                    stuff, as well as an integrated mapping tool which allows you to efficiently maintain the visual
                    component of running combats, usually on a projected screen or TV.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What this app does is make life easier for the lazy DM and keep the game running smoothly. It's not
                    a place where you should keep exstensive notes, but rather a set of convenient tools that help you
                    improvise things and run combat without hassle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is entirely free to use and distribute non-commmercially. Some of the icons were grabbed from <a href ="https://game-icons.net/">game-icons.net</a>. I really hope it's of some use to
                    you! You can change or build upon it if you'd like. See <a

                    The top right searchbar (fig. 1.1) allows you to search for any monsters in the SRD, or homebrew
                    monsters and encounters you have created. The results will displayed in the window below.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Pressing the add button inside the displayed statblock will add the creature or encounter into the
                    combat panel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combat panel has basic combat stats of a creature, as well as a dice roller for attacks.
                    Pressing the creature's name will toggle a more detailed view, including a log of applied damage and
                    healing
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pressing the Apply button will apply damage from the leftmost field. For healing, use negative
                    numbers. If the creature's hit points drop to 0 or less, it will be removed from the panel.
                </p>
                <img src="screenshots/1.2.JPG" style="width:600px"
                    alt="Pressing the creature's name will toggle a more detailed view for that row.">
                <p>
                    Pressing the D20 button will roll an attack for the creature, adding the current attack's modifier
                    to the roll result. If it equals or execeeds the value in the VS AC field, the D20 will turn green,
                    indicating a hit. In the case of a critical hit, the die will turn red. If the attack hits, damage
                    is automatically rolled (dice are doubled in the case of a crititcal hit) and displayed in the
                    rightmost field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the creature has multiple attacks, you can switch between them by pressing the leftmost field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clear (C) button will delete everything from the combat panel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Maptool (M) button will open the maptool, allowing you to add the creatures from the combat
                    panel to the map tool. If the creatures have tokens saved, those tokens are automatically loaded. If
                    a creature is killed in the maptool (by using Kill from the pawn context menu) it will be removed
                    from the combat panel. Likewise, if it's hit points drop to 0 or less in the combat panel, it will
                    be displayed as dead in the map tool.
                </p>

                    used in the Maptool.</p>


                <p>A plaque with the Player Character's key metrics now appears in the main app screen. Pressing the
                    horizontal arrows will switch between alternative AC and regular AC (with or without a shield, for
                    instance). Pressing the up or down arrows
                    will apply a buff/debuff to armor, useful if the PC has a Shield of Faith effect for instance.

                    creature
                    type. </p>

                <p>You can add more constraints, such as the approximate number of creatures in the encounter and the
                    approximate difficulty of the encounter. Once the encounter is generated, you can load it into the

                <h2>Random tables</h2>

                <img src="screenshots/4.8.jpg" class="img_right" alt="Creating a random table named 'Trinkets'.">
                <p>You can create random tables to roll from using the Randomizer tool. Start by opening the Customize
                    tab
                    in the Generate window. Choose "Random Tables" from the drop down menu. Start by typing the table
                    name
                    (fig. 1), and press enter. </p>

                <p>The dump input (fig. 2)is for quickly generating tables from another source. You can paste text into
                    it
                    and generate a random table from that. New lines represent new rows and tab characters represent new
                    columns. A copied table from Excel will have this format.</p>
                <p>Each row represents one entry in the table. The title (fig. 3) and content (fig. 4) columns are
                    simply
                    textual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The percentage (fig. 5) column represents the probability of a that entry being picked. Thus if the
                    first row has a percentage column of 2, and all the other rows have a precentage column of 1, the
                    probability of the first row being picked is double that of the others. <br><br> Note that it does
                    not
                    matter how high the numbers are in the percentage column, as they are normalized when the table is
                    rolled. Thus if the first row has a percentage column of 200 and the others have 100, the first row
                    is
                    still twice as likely to be picked as the others. <br>The percentage column has a default of 1.

                        alt="Linking a your table with another table named 'Trinkets'.">
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can link tables together using the Roll again on column. Type the name of an existing table and
                    if
                    that entry is rolled for the Randomizer will roll again on that table. If you've already created the
                    table a list of autofill suggestions will pop up. Note that if you have not, you must write the
                    table
                    name correctly. If the Roll again column is filled out whatever is written in the
                    title and content columns will be ignored.

                <img src="screenshots/4.10.jpg" class="img_left" alt="Randomly generate a shop.">
                <p>In the Shops tab of the Generator window you can randomly generate magical shops. You can generate a
                    shop of particular type (fig. 1), wealth level (fig. 2), size (fig. 3) and change the general
                    pricing of the shop's items (fig. 4).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A shop will be generated with a description, owner and inventory. If you don't like the inventory
                    generated you can generate another set of inventory without changing the description (fig. 5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see descriptions of the items for sale by hovering over the table. (fig. 6)

            <p>In the Taverns tab of the Generator window you can randomly generate a tavern. You can choose a wealth
                level (fig. 1), a convenient or exotic menu (fig. 2), choose the amount of rumours (fig. 3) and adjust
                pricing (fig. 4). A description of the tavern will generated, as well as a menu and a set of rumors.</p>

            <p> Press the Reroll Rumors/Menu button (fig. 5) if you want to keep the name and description but

            <h1>Adding stuff</h1>
            <p>You can add things to the database. In the Database window, accessible via the main app screen, you can
                select a category (spells, items, homebrew monsters, etc) and add or delete entries to that cateogry.
            </p>
            <article>
                <h1>Monsters/NPC</h1>
                <p>To add a homebrew monster, select the + in the top left corner of the homebrew monster list. A form
                    will appear where you fill out the information for the monster. Most fields are optional but
                    fields which are used by the Map tool (Size) and the Combat panel (Hit points, AC) should be filled
                    out
                    to avoid unpredictable behavior </p>

                <p>
                    Each creature is saved by name, so you cannot save two creatures with the same name. Any field
                    that's left empty will not be saved, if the "Amphibious" Special Ability is left blank, the creature
                    will not have that ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use markdown to style any of the fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Challenge rating calculator gives you an estimated CR of the creature. Defensive CR is
                    calculated from AC and HP, but you must input predicted damage per round and main attack bonus to
                    calculate the offensive CR. Note this is just an estimate.
                </p>

                <p>Once you save the entry, you can search for it in the main app screen and load it into the Combat
                    panel as with creatures from the SRD.</p>

                    press the plus to create a new encounter.</p>

                <p>An encounter has a name, description and creature list. The creature list has an autocomplete
                    feature, and if a creature with a given name is in the database the Challenge rating field will
                    automatically be filled out. It can also be manually changed, if the creature named is not in the
                    database.</p>

                <p>The difficulty calculator will estimate an encounter's difficulty. It either uses the levels of all
                    Player characters that are marked as active in the Party window of the main app screen, or you can
                    manually input the level and party size. </p>

                <p>Once an encounter is saved, you can search for
                        it in the main app screen and load it into the combat panel to easily start the
