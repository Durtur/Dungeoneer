You can end Concentration at any time (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with Concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\n* **Casting another spell that requires Concentration.** You lose Concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires Concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.\n\n* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your Concentration. The DC equals *10 or half the damage you take*, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n\n* **Being Incapacitated or killed. ** You lose Concentration on a spell if you are Incapacitated or if you die.\n\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm--tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration on a spell.\n",
